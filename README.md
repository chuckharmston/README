#  `chuckharmston/README`

I'm Chuck! I am a product manager on the Firefox product development team. I am currently focused on Flourish, a research, experimentation, and testing program that primarily investigates the Firefox front-end.

My product management portfolio has previously included [Firefox Search](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Search), [ARM64 on Windows](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/04/11/firefox-beta-for-windows-10-on-qualcomm-snapdragon-always-connected-pcs-now-available/), [Sherwood](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Sherwood), [Pioneer](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-firefox-pioneer), [Price Wise](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/price-wise/), and [Advance](https://medium.com/firefox-test-pilot/advancing-the-web-f9fe7ca810ec). I've also been an engineer on the [Test Pilot](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Test_Pilot) and [Marketplace](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Marketplace) teams, and prior to my time at Mozilla I was the lead engineer at [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/) and a technical lead at [Threespot](https://www.threespot.com/).

Outside of work:

- I recently got engaged to an long-time friend, and am a future step-dad to a wonderful three-year-old girl.
- I have numerous nerdy pursuits, and am product owner on a popular [Magic: The Gathering hobby site](https://scryfall.com/).
- I cook, as both a love language and a hobby. I land right in the middle of the [Alice Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Waters) and [J. Kenji López-Alt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Kenji_L%C3%B3pez-Alt) spectrum.
- I'm an avid outdoorsman, and have taught technical rock climbing and mountaineering classes at the [Colorado Mountain Club](https://www.cmc.org/).

This document is intended to be an earnest guide to working with me. Writing it has helped me identify and refine my values and working style, and will hopefully also help us have a great relationship. I would like it to both set my expectations for you and provide a baseline for your expectations of me. It's a [living document](https://github.com/chuckharmston/README/blob/master/README.md) with a [public history](https://github.com/chuckharmston/README/commits/master/README.md), and I will periodically update it as appropriate or requested.

## My role

What do product managers do? That's an important question with no straightforward answer. Some of the responsibilities, as described by others:

- Be [an umbrella (of sorts)](https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/14/key-to-gmail/) for my teams: keep them dry when it's raining, but get out of the way when sunny.
- Be a [T-shaped](https://medium.com/pminsider/the-t-shaped-product-manager-c3e4587e5b84) [generalist](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/12/product-managers-generalists/), with a broad understanding of products and product management principles and deep expertise on their product areas.
- Be [an advocate for the user](http://www.cleverpm.com/2017/07/26/the-many-hats-of-the-product-manager/).
- [Be accountable for the decisions my teams make](https://github.com/molly/manager-README), even if I’m not  the one making them.

I strive for all of that, but ultimately see my job as doing what is required to set my teams up for success. Some ways this may happen:

- By providing of context to help my team understand how and why decisions are being made. This should empower them to understand they should do, plan how it should be done, and execute on that plan.
- By establishing a corpus of research to inform our product vision and understanding of users interact with it.
- By balancing what our company needs, what our users need, and what individual team members need.
- By ensuring that my teams get what they need from others, and that other teams get what they need from us.
- By making sure they are successful and happy. I want them to grow their career, enjoy their work, and believe in our shared mission.

## My guiding principles

**I am mission-driven.**  I chose my role carefully; I believe in our company, [our principles](https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/), and our products. I'm constantly working to align my own work with our collective mission, and would appreciate your help holding myself accountable to it.

**I assume positive intent.** As colleagues, we are on the same team, fighting for positive outcomes together. Disagreement on those outcomes or the means to achieve them are natural, and I do my best to assume those challenges to be made in good faith.

**Diversity and inclusion are important to me.** In addition to being a deeply-held personal value, I believe that diverse perspectives are a critical aspect of an effective team. I do my best to embrace different worldviews, backgrounds, and personal characteristics, and want humans of all types to feel welcome, valued, and safe to express themselves.

**I try to practice a [growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/).** I never want to assume that I know everything, and always want to be open to having my assumptions or beliefs challenged.

I make decisions **supported by data**. I believe in my intuition and use it as a starting point, but I always want to validate my assumptions and iterate solutions with data. I believe that both [qualitative and quantitative](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/01/need-quantitative-qualitative-data/) research are important complements, and will seek to understand as much of a problem as is tenable before making decisions.

## How I like to work

I live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, US (in the [Eastern Time Zone](https://time.is/Chapel_Hill)), though I am a morning person and tend to work between 7:30 AM and 4:30 PM local time. I keep my calendar up to date, but am happy to take meetings outside of those hours, especially to accommodate time zone conflicts. If we should speak and my schedule is not clear, get in touch and I’ll make sure we talk that day.

### Directly responsible individuals

I try to exercise Apple's [Directly Responsible Individual](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4) model. In practice, that means:

- I understand and respect your experience and expertise.
- I want to set you up for success. In order to do that well, I need to understand how you think, what motivates you, how you approach problems, and what you think should be worked on or achieved. Help me understand that and I will do my best to accommodate.
- I will have opinions, but you are encouraged to disagree with them. That does not mean you are doing something wrong. The best ideas are refined through healthy discussion and debate, and I will challenge yours hoping to help you come up with the best possible solution. In kind, I hope you’ll challenge mine.
- Consensus, feedback, and iteration are still important, even if you are the responsible party.
- Topic-driven meetings should be adjourned with clear next steps and responsible parties.

### Direct Communication

I believe in [radical candor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KTIEFEE/) and direct, frequent communication:

- I value your time and attention, and will not ask for something of you unless I believe it to be important.
- I respect that some topics will require conversation, while others can be managed asynchronously. To wit, I will do my best to be clear about my communication expectations on any given topic. My preferred communication methods, in descending order of preference:
  - Synchronous: face-to-face, video, phone
  - Asynchronous: Slack, IRC, email

### Feedback

I love receiving feedback, and am always happy to receive it in any form that makes sense: a Slack message, a quick conversation, in regular-scheduled 1:1s, or through this [anonymous feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/3VkPhQhuxecQJzLu2). There are [three important conditions to constructive feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):

1. It must be safe to deliver.
2. It must be easy to deliver.
3. It must result in positive change.

If I fall short on any of those dimensions, I'd love to hear about it.

### Meetings

I appreciate a well-run meeting and relish the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from my colleagues. I prefer meetings to have a predefined purpose and a party responsible for ensuring it serves that purpose. I will always review any preparatory material—a slide deck, document, or agenda—included in an invitation and come prepared with any questions I have. Where applicable, I will also do my best to include that material for my own meetings, and would prefer attendees to review it in advance.

#### 1:1s

I would be happy to hold regular 1:1 meetings with you. I’m here to support you and your growth, and would love to hear how best I can do that. Thus, I prefer that you schedule them and define the format. I will maintain a shared document that we can use both to plan future conversations and reflect upon past ones.

Some characteristics of a good 1:1:

- They are a safe space where both parties feel empowered to express what is on their mind.
- They embrace the [awkward](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c).
- They are focused beyond now: how is your career going? What are your goals? How can I help?
- They build our relationship beyond the status updates and roundtables that happen in broader team meetings.

### Your work/life balance

I want you to have a healthy relationship with your job. Sometimes I work on evenings and weekends; I like the freedom and lack of structure that it allows, and frequently use them for focused work or reflection time. This is my choice. Do not take that as implied pressure to follow suit; if I ask a question outside of normal working hours, it can always wait until the next time you're ready to work.
