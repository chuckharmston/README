#  `chuckharmston/README`

I'm Chuck! I am a product manager on the Firefox team. My portfolio currently includes [Firefox Search](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Search) and [Sherwood](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Sherwood), and I also contribute to [Pioneer](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-firefox-pioneer).  Previously, I was an engineer on the [Test Pilot](https://testpilot.firefox.com) and [Marketplace](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Marketplace) teams. Before Mozilla, I was an engineer at [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/) and technical lead at [Threespot](https://www.threespot.com/).

Outside of work: I have many nerd (I help run a Magic: The Gathering hobby site), an avid outdoorsman (I teach technical rock climbing and mountaineering classes for the [Colorado Mountain Club](https://www.cmc.org/)), and a food and beverage enthusiast (I have a taco + cocktail blog with my partner). I spend an inordinate amount of time in coffee shops, fueling up on caffeine and soaking in the unique culture that they exude. I live for that terribly uncomfortable feeling in your gut when you're in a new place doing new things, either alone or surrounded by people not like you.

This document is intended to be an earnest guide to working with me. Writing it has helped me identify and refine my values and working style, and will hopefully also help us have a great relationship. I would like it to both set my expectations for you and provide a baseline for your expectations of me. It's a [living document](https://github.com/chuckharmston/README/blob/master/README.md) with a [public history](https://github.com/chuckharmston/README/commits/master/README.md), and I will periodically update it as necessary or requested.

## My role

What do product managers do? That's a good, important question with no simple answer. Some of the responsibilities, as described by others:

- Be [an umbrella (of sorts)](https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/14/key-to-gmail/) for my teams: keep them dry when it's raining, but get out of the way when sunny.
- Be a [T-shaped](https://medium.com/pminsider/the-t-shaped-product-manager-c3e4587e5b84) [generalist](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/12/product-managers-generalists/), with a broad understanding of products and product management principles, with deep expertise on their product areas.
- Be [an advocate for the user](http://www.cleverpm.com/2017/07/26/the-many-hats-of-the-product-manager/).
- [Be accountable for the decisions my teams make](https://github.com/molly/manager-README), even if I’m not  the one making them.

I strive for all of that, but I ultimately see my job as doing what is required to set my teams up for success. Some ways this may happen:

- By providing an appropriate amount of context to help my team understand how and why decisions are being made. This should empower them to figure out what to do, how they think it should be done, and to ultimately get it done.
- By establishing a corpus of knowledge to inform our collectively-held believes about our product and how users interact with it.
- By aligning our collective efforts, connecting the dots between what our company needs, what our users need, and what individual team members need.
- By ensuring that my teams get what they need from others, and that other teams get what they need from mine.
- By making sure they are successful and happy. I want them to grow their career, enjoy their work, and believe in our shared mission.

I do _not_ intend to tell my teams what to do or how they should do it.

## My guiding principles

**I am mission-driven.**  I'm at Mozilla for a reason: I believe in us, [our principles](https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/), and our products. I'm constantly working to align my own work with our collective mission, and would appreciate your help holding myself accountable to it.

**I assume positive intent.** As colleagues we are on the same team, fighting for positive outcomes together. Disagreement on those outcomes or the means to achieve them are natural, and I do my best to assume those disagreements to be made in good faith.

**Diversity and inclusion are important to me.** In addition to being a deeply-held personal value, I believe that diverse perspectives are an import aspect of an effective team. I do my best to embrace different viewpoints, backgrounds, and personal characteristics, and want humans of all types to feel welcome, valued, and safe to express their viewpoint.

**I try to practice a [growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/).** I never want to assume that I know everything, and always want to be open to having my assumptions or beliefs challenged.

I make decisions **supported by data**. I believe in my intuition and use it as a starting point, but I always want to validate my assumptions and iterate solutions with data. I believe that both [qualitative and quantitative](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/01/need-quantitative-qualitative-data/) research are important complements, and will seek to understand as much of a problem as is tenable before making decisions.

## How I like to work

I am located in Denver, Colorado, US (in the [Mountain Time Zone](https://time.is/Denver)), though am a morning person and tend to work between 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM local time. I keep my calendar up to date ([you can view availability and book meetings here](https://calendly.com/chuckharmston)), but am happy to take meetings outside of those hours, especially to accommodate time zone conflicts. I have blocked off 11:00-3:00 Pacific on Tuesdays and Fridays as dedicated work time, but there's no need to treat that time as sacred; please feel free to schedule during it if other options are not tenable.

If you want or need to speak with me and my schedule is _not_ open, get in touch and I’ll make sure we talk that day.

### Directly responsible individuals

I try to exercise Apple's [Directly Responsible Individual](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4) model. In practice, that means:

- I understand and respect your experience and expertise.
- I want to set you up for success. In order to do that well, I need to understand how you think, what motivates you, how you approach problems, and what you think should be worked on or achieved. Help me understand that and I will do my best to accommodate.
- I will have opinions, but you are encouraged to disagree with them. That does not mean you are doing something wrong. The best ideas are refined through healthy discussion and debate, and I will challenge yours hoping to help you come up with the best possible solution. In kind, I hope you’ll challenge mine.
- Consensus, feedback, and iteration are still important, even if you are the responsible party.
- Topic-driven meetings should be adjourned with clear next steps and responsible parties.

### Direct Communication

Though I am not your (or anybody's) manager, I believe in [radical candor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KTIEFEE/) and direct, frequent communication:

- I value your time and attention, and will not ask for something of you unless I believe it to be important.
- I respect that some topics will require conversation, while others can be managed asynchronously. To wit, I will do my best to be clear about my communication expectations on any given topic. My preferred communication methods, in descending order of preference:
  - Synchronous: face-to-face, video, phone
  - Asynchronous: Slack, IRC, email

### Feedback

I love receiving feedback, and am always happy to receive it in any form that makes sense: a Slack message, a quick conversation, in regular-scheduled 1:1s, or through this [anonymous feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/3VkPhQhuxecQJzLu2). There are [three important conditions to constructive feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):

1. It must be safe to deliver.
2. It must be easy to deliver.
3. It must result in positive change.

If I fall short on any of those dimensions, I'd love to hear about it.

### Meetings

I like meetings (or at least, well-run ones) and relish the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from our great people. I prefer meetings to have a predefined purpose and a party responsible for ensuring it serves that purpose. I will always review any preparatory material—a slide deck, document, or agenda—included in an invitation and come prepared with any questions I have. Where applicable, I will also do my best to include that material for my own meetings, and would prefer attendees to review it in advance.

#### 1:1s

I would be happy to hold regular 1:1 meetings with you. I’m here to support you and your growth, so I prefer that you let me know how best I can do that. Thus, I prefer that you schedule them, set the agenda, and define the format. I will maintain a shared document that we can use both to plan future conversations and reflect upon past ones.

Some characteristics of a good 1:1:

- They are a safe space where both parties feel empowered to express what is on their mind.
- They are [awkward](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c).
- They are focused beyond now: how is your career going? What are your goals? How can I help?
- They build our relationship beyond the status updates and roundtables that happen in greater team meetings.

### Work and life

I want to empower you to have a healthy relationship with your job. Sometimes I work on evenings and weekends; I like the freedom and lack of structure that it allows, and frequently use them for focused work or reflection time. This is my choice. Do not take that as implied pressure to follow suit; even if I email or Slack something to you, it can always wait until the next time you're ready to work.

## Miscellany

Some unorganized information that may help you work with me:

- I am extroverted and enthusiastic. This can be a strength, but is sometimes unwanted. I'm very open to being told to tone it down.
- Opinions and intuition are useful, so long as they're treated as what they are. If you want to persuade me, use facts.
- I bias toward transparency, but I work on some sensitive stuff that I may not always be at liberty to discuss. I will be clear when that is the case, and am committed to never lying.
- I am averse to [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), and will try to refocus meetings that devolve into it.
- I am a former engineer. It helps me appreciate engineering concerns, but also creates some weaknesses that I try to be aware of.
- I've written a great detail about how I prefer to work and what I value, but part of my job is adapting to what my teams need. I look forward to hearing about them!
- I would be very grateful to hear what you think this document is missing.
